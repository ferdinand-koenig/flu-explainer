1. User Experience (UX)

Ease of Use: Is the prototype intuitive and easy to navigate?
yes

Engagement: Does it keep users interested and engaged?
Yes, look good

Accessibility: Can people of all abilities use the prototype effectively?

→ Add feature selection for data sheet tab
→ leave out neuron/net on model label tab → confusing

2. User Interface (UI)

Visual Design: Are the aesthetics appealing and appropriate for the target audience? fine

Consistency: Is the interface consistent in terms of layout, color, and typography? fine
Feedback: Does the prototype provide clear feedback to user actions? not yet

3. Functionality

Core Features: Do the main functions of the prototype work as expected? Not yet
Performance: Is the prototype responsive and quick in its operations? Not yet
Reliability: Does it function reliably without errors or crashes?  Not yet



4. Alignment with User Needs

Problem-Solution Fit: Does the prototype address the key problems identified during user
research?

User Empathy: Does it reflect a deep understanding of user needs and behaviors? Should do that in future; thats why we separate by stakeholder

Scalability: Can the solution grow or adapt based on evolving user needs? yes


additional→ provide confusion matrix with percentages instead of absolute numbers


5. Innovation and Creativity

Originality: How unique is the approach or solution? fairly

Creativity: Are there novel features or innovative design elements?
no

Differentiation: Does it stand out from existing solutions?
Cannot tell


6. Feasibility

Technical Feasibility: Is the prototype realistic to build with current technology?
yes

Resource Feasibility: Can it be developed within budget and time constraints?
yes

Yes but less models would be easier/faster; maybe train 4 and use the best two

User Adoption: Is the solution likely to be adopted by the target audience?
it depends on the audience


7. Presentation and Communication

Clarity: Is the concept clearly communicated through the prototype:
yes; very generic

Storytelling: Does the presentation tell a compelling story?
yes
